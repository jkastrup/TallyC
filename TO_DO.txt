TO DO
-----
Create vehicle display controller and model
	-Model should return query of all vehicles
	-Controller should check if those vehicles exist
	-View should display and format the data sent from controller
		* For each vehicle, check if it exists (vehicle_model/isAdded($vehicleID))
		* if it exists, add 'exists' class to that .vehicle-info
Create Controller for estimation.php
	- Can use vehicle model to get all cars for dropdown in form (possibly fix glitch with dropdown not showing all vehicles)
		* Controller should handle all calculations, as well as serving the entire list of cars to the view
	- NEW View (estimation_view.php) should handle all the display
