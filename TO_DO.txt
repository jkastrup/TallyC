TO DO
-----
Create vehicle display controller and model
Model should return query of all vehicles
Controller should check if those vehicles exist
View should display and format the data sent from controller
	- For each vehicle, check if it exists (vehicle_model/isAdded($vehicleID))
	- if it exists, add 'exists' class to that .vehicle-info
